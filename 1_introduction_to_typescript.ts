// typescript is superset of javascript
// it is used to write javascript in a much more precise manner and catch errors while
// writing the code itself
// we can say typescript is just -> type safely

// what do typescript do -> static checking
// its just like analysing your code as you write and alert you about the potentail errors
// you might get
// which is not in javascript as anything is ok for javascript while writing
// and it throws errors in runtime

// actually the typescript code is compiled or transpiled to javascript only
// you can say it is a development tool and it is like a layer
// in actual your code is actually javascript
